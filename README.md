Simple Login and Registration Page:
This project is a basic web page that includes both login and registration forms with animated backgrounds and icons. It is created using HTML and CSS.

Files:
index.html: The main HTML file that structures the page.
styles.css: The CSS file that styles the page.

Dependencies:
Boxicons: An icon library used to add icons to the input fields. It is included via a CDN link in the HTML file.

Functionality:
Forms: Both forms currently have placeholders for form submission and do not perform any actual login or registration actions.
Links: Placeholder links are included to switch between the login and registration forms. JavaScript can be added to make these links functional.

Potential Enhancements:
Add JavaScript to toggle between login and registration forms.
Implement form validation and error handling.
Connect to a backend service to handle actual authentication.
Improve the styling and animations for a better user experience.

Conclusion:
This project provides a basic template for a login and registration page. It can be further developed with additional functionality and enhanced styling to create a more robust and user-friendly application.
