Simple Login and Registration Page
Overview
This project is a basic web page that includes both login and registration forms with animated backgrounds and icons. It is created using HTML and CSS.

Files
index.html: The main HTML file that structures the page.
styles.css: The CSS file that styles the page.
Dependencies
Boxicons: An icon library used to add icons to the input fields. It is included via a CDN link in the HTML file.
HTML Structure
Head Section: Contains meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings, the title of the page, and links to the CSS file and Boxicons library.
Body Section: Includes:
A wrapper div that contains the entire content of the page.
Animated background elements for visual effects.
A login form with input fields for username and password, and a login button.
A registration form with input fields for username and password, and a signup button.
Links to switch between the login and registration forms.
An informational text section that welcomes returning users.
CSS Styling
The CSS file styles the body, wrapper, input fields, buttons, and background animations. It ensures the forms are properly aligned and visually appealing.

Functionality
Forms: Both forms currently have placeholders for form submission and do not perform any actual login or registration actions.
Links: Placeholder links are included to switch between the login and registration forms. JavaScript can be added to make these links functional.
Potential Enhancements
Add JavaScript to toggle between login and registration forms.
Implement form validation and error handling.
Connect to a backend service to handle actual authentication.
Improve the styling and animations for a better user experience.
Conclusion
This project provides a basic template for a login and registration page. It can be further developed with additional functionality and enhanced styling to create a more robust and user-friendly application.
